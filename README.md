# AuthService

AuthService is a simple authentication built on the Express.
It is meant to be a modular authentication solution that is run in conjunction with other services.

This project is a solo experiment, and the first of a series I plan to build in order to learn Node.JS, API security, and the microservices architecture.

It is currently in the early stages of development.
I am still learning API security best practices.
It goes without saying that this service is not currently fit to be run in a production environment.
